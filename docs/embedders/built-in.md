:::info Heads up!

This embedding model will download (25mb) on the very first embed **and** runs on CPU. You should have at least 2GB of RAM available to ensure the process does not bottleneck.

AnythingLLM ships with a built-in embedder model that runs on CPU. The model is the popular [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) model, which is primarily trained on English documents.
