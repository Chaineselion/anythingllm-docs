:::info Heads up!

By default, AnythingLLM will use an open-source on-instance vector database so that your document text and embeddings never leave the AnythingLLM application.

:::

AnythingLLM ships with [LanceDB](https://lancedb.com) built-in. LanceDB can scale to millions of vectors all on disk with zero configuration and incredible retrieval speed.

_there is no configuration or options required for LanceDB_
