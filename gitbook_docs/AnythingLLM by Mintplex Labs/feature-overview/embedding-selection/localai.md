[LocalAi ](https://localai.io)is a full-feature CLI application that you can run to easily spin up an API server for chatting with open-source models found on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.com) as well as running embedding models!



AnythingLLM supports the use of a private API key for accessing your LocalAI API!

You are responsible for running and maintaining your instance of LocalAI so that AnythingLLM can use it for embedding text.

Like other providers, the Embedding Model Selection dropdown will automatically populate when your key is entered. All models in your installation will be available to you for embedding.
