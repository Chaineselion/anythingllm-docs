It is possible to use Microsoft Azure for your embedding model. This allows you to use embedding models in a private and enterprise environment that is managed by Microsoft.



Currently, only the text-ada-embedding-002 embedding model is available to be run in Azure OpenAi.

There are limitations to the use of Azure embedding models, but AnythingLLM handles them behind the scenes for you!
