To use OpenAI embedding models you will need a [Developer API key](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) which will require you to attach a card for OpenAI billing. You only pay for what you use.

Fine-tuned models for the embedding model are available and can be used with AnythingLLM!

OpenAi currently offers one embedding model selection: **text-ada-embedding-002.** This model outputs a 1,536-dimension vector per embedding. You can use this service by getting an API key from OpenAI.
