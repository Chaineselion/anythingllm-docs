[Anthropic](https://Anthropic.com) is a model provider popular for hosting models like Claude-2 that boast much larger context windows.

Model providers like Anthropic do not provide an embedding service alongside their chat service so additional configuration is required to upload custom documents

Access to Anythopic Developer API keys is currently waitlisted. You will need access to their developer API to use this feature.

Like other LLM providers, the Chat Model Selection dropdown will automatically populate when you key is entered. All Anthropic models are currently available for use with AnythingLLM.
