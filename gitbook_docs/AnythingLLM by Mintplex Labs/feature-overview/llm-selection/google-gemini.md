[Google's Gemini Pro](https://ai.google.dev/) is a model that runs with GPT equivalent responses and currently is free to use - you just need to sign up for an API key.

Currently, only `gemini-pro` is the only available model for use.

Model providers like Google Gemini do not provide an embedding service alongside their chat service so additional configuration is required to upload custom documents

Google Gemini is in public beta and its configuration with AnythingLLM is subject to breaking changes that may occur as Google makes updates to the API.
