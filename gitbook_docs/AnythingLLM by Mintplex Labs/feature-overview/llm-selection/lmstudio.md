[LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai) is a desktop application that you can run to easily spin up an API server for chatting with open-source models found on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.com).



You are responsible for running and maintaining your instance of LMStudio so that AnythingLLM can chat with it and use it for generative responses!

LMStudio does not support embedding models and will require additional setup to chat with documents.

Like other LLM providers, the Chat Model Selection dropdown will automatically populate when your key is entered. All models in your installation will be available to you for chatting.
