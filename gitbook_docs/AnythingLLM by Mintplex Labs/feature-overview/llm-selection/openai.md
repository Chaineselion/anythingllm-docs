To use OpenAI models you will need a [Developer API key](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) which will require you to attach a card for OpenAI billing. You only pay for what you use and the model selection.

View their pricing for up-to-date pricing per model.

When you use [OpenAI](https://openai.com) as your LLM provider you only need to set a single API key. AnythingLLM will also allow you to select additional **fine-tuned** models that are present on your account. Once your API key is entered you will see the dropdown populate with all models available to you.

Selecting the dropdown will show all models available on your account including fine-tunes.

**Using a custom model? **Only fine tunes that leverage a **chat model like GPT-3.5** will work for LLM selection. Do not use an embedding model to chat or your chat will fail.
