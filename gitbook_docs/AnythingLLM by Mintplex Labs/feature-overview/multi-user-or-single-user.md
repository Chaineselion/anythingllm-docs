AnythingLLM supports two types of use cases

## Single-player mode

Single-player mode is preferred for those who only themselves or a select group of trusted people. If you want to have per-user permissions you should switch to multi-user mode.

Single-player mode is when you (and only you) are going to use AnythingLLM. You will have complete control over the instance. Anyone with the password to the instance, if set, will be able to use the instance and change any configuration or settings on the instance as well as view all chats.

## Multi-user mode

The preferred method of use for AnythingLLM is **multi-user mode**. In this mode, you can set per-user role-based access permissions.

By default, you will create the administrator account. This is the highest level privilege and you will have access to the entire system, logs, analytics, and more.

Admin

Full-Access to entire system

Manager

Can view all workspaces, and manage all properties except for settings for LLM, Embedder, and Vector database

Default

Can only send chats to workspaces they are explicitly added to. Cannot see or edit any workspaces or system settings.
