**Once in multi-user mode, you cannot revert back to single-user mode!**

Toggling on the toggle for "Enable multi-user mode" will show an input where you can input the username and password for the first admin account. This will be the default admin account that you will use to control the instance.

Once set, you will be logged out so you can login with the new password.
