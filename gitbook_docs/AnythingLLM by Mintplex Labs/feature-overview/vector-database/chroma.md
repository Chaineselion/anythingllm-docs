[Chroma](https://trychroma.com) is an open source vector database that you can run on another server or alongside AnythingLLM.



You are responsible for setting up & maintaining your installation of Chroma. AnythingLLM will begin to store information in Chroma automatically once connected.

The API key and header are optional for Chroma if your installation of Chroma does not require it.
